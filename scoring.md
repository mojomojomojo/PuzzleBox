# Scoring Algorithm

  * no long verticals
  * no traps that start with "down"
  * has choices
  * pull+L/R doesn't solve it
  * solution has turns that aren't at corners
  * no trap at the end (nobody would ever try it)
  * wasted trap (size/length)
  * how much space is in good traps
  * length of solution
